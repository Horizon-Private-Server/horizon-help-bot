    node_definition:
      - "Nodes are capturable control points in UYA multiplayer that, once taken, provide team resources such as spawn locations, weapons, ammo, vehicles, or defensive support, making them key strategic assets."

    node_capture_mechanics:
      - "To capture a node, players must destroy its neutral or enemy AI defenses (turrets and NPCs) and then activate the bolt crank, converting the node to their team's control."

    node_defense_before_capture:
      - "Uncaptured nodes are protected by neutral automated turrets and sometimes NPC defenders, which must be cleared before the node can be captured."

    node_state_change_on_capture:
      - "When captured, a node changes to the team's color and activates as a functional hub, enabling respawns and potentially dispensing weapons, vehicles, or other resources."

    node_resource_provision:
      - "Depending on the map and node type, captured nodes can supply resources such as weapons, ammunition, drone bots, or vehicles."

    node_presence_by_game_mode:
      - "Nodes are a core mechanic in Siege mode, where they are always present, and may also appear in Capture the Flag depending on map configuration."

    node_respawn_importance:
      - "Controlling nodes allows teams to respawn closer to contested areas, reducing downtime and enabling faster re-entry into combat."

    node_strategic_value:
      - "Nodes function as forward control hubs that improve map presence, sustain offensive pressure, and enhance a team's ability to hold territory."

    node_denial_penalty:
      - "If a team loses all nodes, they are forced to respawn only at base, increasing travel time to objectives and reducing their ability to contest the map effectively."

    node_team_strategy:
      - "Effective team play involves capturing forward nodes, denying enemy spawn access, and using node control to maintain map flow and offensive momentum."

    player_respawn_rules:
      - "After a short delay, players respawn at either their base or a friendly-controlled node, allowing teams to re-enter the battlefield from positions they control."
