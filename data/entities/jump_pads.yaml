    jump_pad_definition:
      - "Jump pads are fixed, map-embedded launch devices that function like static lifts, propelling players into the air to reach elevated areas, high ground, or distant platforms that cannot be accessed with normal jumps."

    jump_pad_purpose:
      - "Jump pads provide fast vertical mobility, allowing players to bypass obstacles and access map sections that can't be reached on foot, including sniper towers, node platforms, and other key vantage points."

    jump_pad_map_presence:
      - "Jump pads appear across multiple UYA maps to enable vertical traversal and high-ground control; for example, Bakisi Isles and Hoven Gorge use jump pads to reach sniper towers, upper platforms, and elevated node positions."
