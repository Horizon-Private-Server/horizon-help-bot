    map: "Outpost X12"

  entries:
    map_general_structure:
      - "Outpost X12 is a large asymmetric Aridia desert canyon map with fragmented landmasses, chasms, plateaus, tunnels, bridges, and vertical traversal routes including grav-ramps and swingshots."

    map_nicknames:
      - "Outpost X12 is commonly abbreviated as 'X12'."

    map_big_or_small:
      - "Outpost X12 is a big map designed for Siege-style play with capturable nodes, static defenses, and extended objective control."

    map_base_defenses:
      - "Blue base defenses include Shock Droids and gatling turrets, while Red base defenses include Ball Bots and gatling turrets."

    map_base_locations:
      - "Red base is on the far left island and Blue base is on the far right island, with contested nodes between them."

    map_nodes:
      - "Node control spans base-adjacent starts, plateau control points, and a central hovering platform node that governs movement, vehicle access, and mid-map pressure."

    map_node_strategic_value:
      - "Starting nodes unlock map progression, plateau nodes provide Hovership or anti-air assets, and central platform control suppresses enemy routes while expanding team mobility and dominance."

    map_trooper_locations:
      - "Neutral Galactic Rangers guard the first capturable nodes near both team bases."

    map_sniper:
      - "Elevated crevices and cliffs near grav-ramp routes provide sniper sightlines over bridges, node approaches, and vehicle lanes."

    map_terrain_features:
      - "Outpost X12 combines steep elevation shifts, narrow bridges, cliffs, tunnels, hovering platforms, and destructible traversal structures that create chokepoints and flank paths."

    map_vehicle_types:
      - "Outpost X12 includes Turbosliders from base-adjacent nodes and Hovership access from right-plateau node control."

    map_turboslider_tactics:
      - "Turbosliders enable rapid rotations between early nodes, quick reinforcement, and fast contests of plateau and mid-map objectives."

    map_hovership_tactics:
      - "Hoverships provide aerial mobility over chasms for pressure, scouting, and support around plateau and central platform fights."

    map_counter_air_dominance_strategies:
      - "Air threats are countered with elevated Flux or Minirocket fire, left-plateau anti-air assets, and central platform control to suppress Hovership movement."
