    weapon: "Mine Glove"

  entries:
    weapon_identity:
      - "The Mine Glove is a tactical area-denial weapon that deploys ground-based proximity mines which remain hidden until enemies approach and then detonate."

      - "The Mine Glove has no widely used nickname and is typically referred to by its full name in both casual and competitive play."

    weapon_damage_behavior:
      - "When triggered by enemy proximity, mines briefly home in before exploding for high, often lethal close-range damage with potential splash impact."

    weapon_ammo_capacity:
      - "The Mine Glove allows up to 6 active deployed mines at once, and placing a 7th removes the oldest mine."

      - "The Mine Glove upgrades automatically after 3 kill or assist contributions from mines, following the standard weapon progression system."

    weapon_upgrade_effects:

    weapon_map_control_value:
      - "By mining key routes, teams can funnel enemy movement, force rerouting or splash-clearing, delay coordinated pushes, and create more predictable engagements."
