    weapon: "N60 Storm"

  entries:
    weapon_identity:
      - "The N60 Storm is a dual-barreled rapid-fire energy blaster pistol and default multiplayer starting weapon, designed for continuous ranged fire with low per-shot damage and minimal burst potential."

    weapon_nickname:
      - "Players commonly abbreviate the N60 Storm as 'N60' in gameplay and team communication."

    weapon_damage_behavior:
      - "The N60 Storm fires fast, low-damage energy projectiles with moderate accuracy and slow travel speed, relying on sustained volume of fire to wear down enemies but struggling to secure eliminations due to weak per-shot impact."

    weapon_ammo_capacity:
      - "The N60 Storm carries 500 rounds per pickup, enabling extended sustained fire to compensate for its low damage output and slow projectile speed."

    weapon_multi_target_utility:
      - "The N60 Storm is strictly single-target with no splash damage, only capable of hitting multiple enemies if they are perfectly aligned."

    weapon_anti_air_capability:
      - "The N60 Storm can technically harass airborne targets, but its slow projectile speed, low damage, and unreliable hit consistency make it ineffective as a dedicated anti-air option."

    weapon_upgrade_mechanism:
      - "After contributing to 3 kills or assists, the N60 Storm upgrades to the N90 Hurricane."

    weapon_upgrade_effects:
      - "The N90 Hurricane increases fire rate and damage output to improve suppression and pressure, though it still lacks strong burst lethality."

    weapon_defensive_role:
      - "Defensively, the N60 Storm provides ranged chip damage and suppression against flag runners or pushes but is too weak to reliably secure kills or hold critical points alone."

    weapon_community_opinion:
      - "The N60 Storm is widely regarded as a weak fallback starting weapon used primarily for harassment or cleanup, and is quickly replaced once stronger pickups become available."

    weapon_usage_techniques:
      - "Players use the N60 Storm from cover to chip enemies, finish low-health targets at range, tag fleeing opponents, and slowly damage static objectives such as turrets or drones."

    weapon_meta_role:
      - "In the multiplayer meta, the N60 Storm functions as a ranged harassment and placeholder weapon used at match start or until stronger weapons are acquired."

    weapon_map_control_value:
      - "Because all players spawn with the N60 Storm, it has no crate or map control value and is never contested as a strategic pickup."
