    map: "Korgon Outpost"

  entries:
    map_general_structure:
      - "Korgon Outpost is a medium-large jungle island map on Tyhrranosis with opposite-end bases, a central facility with ramp control, and layered routes through cliffs, bridges, and elevated lanes."

    map_nicknames:
      - "Korgon Outpost is commonly called 'Korg'."

    map_big_or_small:
      - "Korgon Outpost is a big map designed for Siege-style play with capturable nodes, base defenses, and vehicle-based pressure."

    map_base_defenses:
      - "Red base defenses include Shock Droids and gatling turrets, while Blue base defenses include Ball Bots and gatling turrets."

    map_base_locations:
      - "Red and Blue bases are placed at opposite ends of the island with symmetrical travel distance but varied bridge and terrain approaches."

    map_nodes:
      - "Korgon Outpost has major nodes outside each base, on the southern flanks, and at the central building, supporting multi-lane control."

    map_node_strategic_value:
      - "Southern nodes unlock Hovership and flank access, the central node controls ramp direction and direct routes, and broader node control improves vehicles, weapons, and map flow dominance."

    map_trooper_locations:
      - "Korgon Outpost has no neutral troopers or Galactic Rangers."

    map_trooper_locations:
      - "Neutral Galactic Rangers defend the central building node and nearby node areas."

    map_sniper:
      - "Northern sniper towers and high ground provide Flux Rifle access and long sightlines over central and flank movement corridors."

    map_terrain_features:
      - "The map combines jungle cover, cliffs, bridges, side ramps, and a vertical central interior with dynamic traversal and chokepoints."

    map_vehicle_types:
      - "Korgon Outpost includes Turbosliders and Hoverships, with vehicle access tied to node control."

    map_turboslider_tactics:
      - "Turbosliders are used for fast north-to-center rotations, flank pressure, and rapid node contests when ramp control is favorable."

    map_hovership_tactics:
      - "Hoverships provide aerial repositioning and suppression of bridges, nodes, and base exits while supporting central fights."

    map_counter_air_dominance_strategies:
      - "Air pressure is countered with Flux and Minirocket fire from high ground, node denial to prevent Hovership access, and Holoshields at key approaches."
